### "...for boxing is about failure far more than it is about success."

There are no shortage of reviews and responses to this timeless Joyce Carol Oates anthology of essays about, and on, boxing. And rightly so. For a longtime outsider to the world of combat sports who only started paying more attention recently, beginning with Mayweather vs. Pacquiao last year, *On Boxing* captures perfectly what is so electric and captivating about boxing.

I can tell you, though, that it's not a rigid historical account of the all of the great 20th century boxing moments. Instead, this book explains *why* boxing is so enthralling. Boxing is in many ways the most primitive of sports, but Oates does a masterful job of encapsulating those ancient feelings and actions with words. This book, while short, is not superficial. *On Boxing* places you decades deep inside the culture of boxing. It's like when you listen to your grandfather talk about his past or when someone like Elon Musk talks about technology, some people have a way of communicating the essence of something so well that you walk away with your mouth wide open because things make *sense* now. That is what Oates has done. A lifetime of experience in only 200 some odd pages. Not a bad deal.

To illustrate, Oates in her own words on boxing:
> Which returns us to the paradox of boxing: its obsessive appeal for many who find in it not only a spectacle involving sensational feats of physical skill but an emotional experience impossible to convey in words; an art form, as I've suggested, with no natural analogue in the arts. Of course it is primitive, too, as birth, death and erotic love might be said to be primitive, and forces our reluctant acknowledgement of that the most profound experiences of our lives are physical eventsâ€”though we believe ourselves to be, and surely are, essentially spiritual beings.
