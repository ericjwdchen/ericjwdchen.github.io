The Genesis
--------------

I suppose I can blame my sister for introducing me to podcasts. When she was in high school, instead of getting an iPod Classic, she got a first-generation [Zune](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zune) (a white Zune 30 to be specific). Like many other [Zune owners](http://www.wired.com/2009/09/zune-tattoo/), she was disappointed and quickly got the iPod.
