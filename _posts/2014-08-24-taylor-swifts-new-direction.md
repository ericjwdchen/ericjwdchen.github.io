title: Taylor Swift's New Direction

<div class="message">
  I will use the past tense to refer to everything previous to Taylor's new album, *1989*, and the present tense to refer to the *1989* era. [^1]

I haven't been on the Taylor Swift bandwagon forever. When I first heard "Teardrops on My Guitar," I wrote her off as kitschy and "a fad."

But as things have their way of happening, no longer than two years after my initial sour reaction, my opinions changed. I saw past my first impressions and fell in love with her music.

Five years ago I couldn't have told you what made Taylor's music was so magnetic. It just was.

Now, though, I know what that "X-Factor" was. Note, though, that what I'm going to say is far from novel[^2].

Here are two examples:

<br>
<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/QSMOcaZlMUI?start=46&amp;end=70' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

I was attracted to the anecdotes.

>When you think happiness <br>
>I hope you think that little black dress <br>
>Think of my head on your chest <br>
>And my old faded blue jeans <br>
>When you think Tim McGraw <br>
>I hope you think of me

>The playful conversation starts <br>
>Counter all your quick remarks <br>
>Like passing notes in secrecy

Those short little moments full of feeling and depth. *I* was a part of Taylor's life. I knew her breakups, her friends, her loneliness. I knew about [her freshman year crush on that guy named Drew](www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKCek6_dB0M).

Taylor was so transparent. She could match the massive appeal of [Katy Perry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F57P9C4SAW4) while writing about [one, single guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y28pUGkk9vc).
