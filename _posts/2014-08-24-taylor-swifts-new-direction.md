title: Taylor Swift's New Direction
---

Note, I will use the past tense to refer to everything previous to Taylor's new album, *1989*, and the present tense to refer to the *1989* era. [^1]

I haven't been on the Taylor Swift bandwagon forever. When I first heard "Teardrops on My Guitar," I wrote her off as kitschy and "a fad."

But as things have their way of happening, no longer than two years after my initial sour reaction, my opinions changed. I saw past my first impressions and fell in love with her music.

Five years ago I couldn't have told you what made Taylor's music was so magnetic. It just was.

Now, though, I know what that "X-Factor" was.[^2]

Here are two examples:

<p><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/QSMOcaZlMUI?start=46&amp;end=70' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>

I was attracted to the anecdotes.

>When you think happiness <br>
>I hope you think that little black dress <br>
>Think of my head on your chest <br>
>And my old faded blue jeans <br>
>When you think Tim McGraw <br>
>I hope you think of me

>The playful conversation starts <br>
>Counter all your quick remarks <br>
>Like passing notes in secrecy

Those moments full of feeling and depth. *I* was a part of Taylor's life. I was a part of her freshmen year. I knew about [her crush on that guy named Drew][freshman crush]. I knew about [the time when she thought she fell in love][fifteen song]. She could match the massive appeal of [Katy Perry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F57P9C4SAW4) while writing about [one, single guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y28pUGkk9vc).

Which is way "Shake It Off" worries me.

What happened? I suppose this change was a long time coming. Taylor has sold more than 34 million albums[^3]


[^1]: *1989* era â‰  1980s/1990s. Kind of confusing, but bear with me.

[^2]: Note, though, that what I'm going to say is far from novel. It's been said [many][] [times][] [before][].

[^3]: 26 million from [this 2011 press release][Big Machine press release] plus 8 million from RED
