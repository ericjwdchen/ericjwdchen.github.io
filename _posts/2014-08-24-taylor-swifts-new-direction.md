title: Taylor Swift's New Direction
---

Note, I will use the past tense to refer to everything previous to Taylor's new album, *1989*, and the present tense to refer to the *1989* era. [^1]

I haven't been on the Taylor Swift bandwagon forever. When I first heard "Teardrops on My Guitar," I wrote her off as kitschy and "a fad."

But as things have their way of happening, no longer than two years after my initial sour reaction, my opinions changed. I saw past my first impressions and fell in love with her music.

Five years ago I couldn't have told you what made Taylor's music was so magnetic. It just was.

Now, though, I know what that "X-Factor" was.[^2]

Here are two examples:

<p><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/QSMOcaZlMUI?start=46&amp;end=70' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>

I was attracted to the anecdotes.

>When you think happiness <br>
>I hope you think that little black dress <br>
>Think of my head on your chest <br>
>And my old faded blue jeans <br>
>When you think Tim McGraw <br>
>I hope you think of me

>The playful conversation starts <br>
>Counter all your quick remarks <br>
>Like passing notes in secrecy

Those moments full of feeling and depth. *I* was a part of Taylor's life. I was a part of her freshmen year. I knew about [her crush on that guy named Drew][freshman crush]. I knew about [the time when she thought she fell in love][fifteen song]. She could match the massive appeal of [Katy Perry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F57P9C4SAW4) while writing about [one, single guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y28pUGkk9vc).

Which is way "Shake It Off" worries me.

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/nfWlot6h_JM?start=16&amp;end=40' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

What happened? I suppose this change was a long time coming. Taylor has sold more than 34 million albums, [^3] has won [*226* awards][Taylor Swift awards list], and lives in a [New York City penthouse][]. So should I be surprised that *Shake It Off* lacks the small-town stories of yesteryear?

No. I shouldn't be. It was clear from *RED* that change was afoot.

*We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together* (WANEGBT) still was personal, but all signs turned toward pop. The lyrics lacked passion. The days of faded blue jeans, old Chevy trucks, and princesses were gone. The song was no longer driven by songwriting. Instead, WANEGBT relied on the incessant beat of a kick drum.
