title: Taylor Swift's New Direction: Inevitable, Disappointing, and Ridiculously Irresistible
---

I haven't been on the Taylor Swift bandwagon forever. When I first heard "Teardrops on My Guitar", I wrote her off as kitschy and "a fad."

But as things have their way of happening, no longer than two years after my initial sour reaction, my opinions changed. I saw past my first impressions and fell in love with her music.

Five years ago I couldn't have told you what about Taylor's music was so magnetic. It just was.

Now, though, I know what that "X-Factor" was[^1].
