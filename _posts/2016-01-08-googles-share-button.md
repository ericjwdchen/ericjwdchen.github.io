title: Google's Share Button
---

Google's Material Design promises to not only to bring consistency across products, but also to bring consistency within Google’s design language itself.

In the [Material Design documentation][MD doc], there are [best practices][bp] for system icons:

> Consistency aids user comprehension of icons. Use the existing system icons whenever possible and across different applications.

Which is all well and good. That's what system icons should do. They should be consistent and clear. But not everyone within Google has gotten the message yet.

## The Canonical Share Icon

This is Google's [sanctioned][sanctioned] share button.

The icon is three nodes with lines connecting each of them. There isn't any [universal icon][ui] for sharing, but this one is reasonably clear.

And most Google properties use the right one.

## The Reply Icon

This is Google's [reply][r] icon.

Here is the reply icon in Gmail.

## The Wrong Share Icon (the mirrored reply)

But the Android YouTube app uses this.[^1]

Here it is in action.

This button is  worse than being obscure. It’s confusing because it's almost identical to the reply icon.

Inexplicable. A bad icon badly points in the general direction of its functionality. A terrible icon boldly points in the wrong way.

[^1]: Google Trends also [falls victim][fv] to the non-standard share button.
