title: Google's Share Button
---

Google's Material Design promises to not only to bring consistency across products, but also to bring consistency within Google’s design language itself.

In the design documentation, there are best practices for system icons:

> Consistency aids user comprehension of icons. Use the existing system icons whenever possible and across different applications.

Which is all well and good. That's what system icons should do. They should be consistent and clear. But not everyone within Google has gotten the message yet.

## The Canonical Share Button

This is the Google's [sanctioned][sanctioned] share button.

It's three nodes with lines connecting each of them. There isn't any great icon for sharing, but this one is reasonably clear.

And most Google properties use the right one.

## The Wrong Share Button

But the Android Youtube app uses this.

Here it is in action.

This button is almost worse than being obscure. It’s legitimately confusing because the [mirrored version of the glyph][reply] means reply.

Here is the reply icon in GMail.

And here it is in use in Inbox.

Inexplicable. A bad icon badly points in the general direction of its functionality. A terrible icon boldly points in the wrong way. Let's make 2016 the year of the consistent share button.
