title: Making Measurements

I'm writing this right when the iPhone X is coming out, and I'm surprised by how many phone reviewers seem to equate screen size to the diagonal length of the display.

[Kif Leswing of Business Insider in an article titled "The iPhone X is smaller than the iPhone 8 Plus, but it has the largest iPhone screen Apple has ever made"](http://www.businessinsider.com/iphone-x-screen-size-vs-iphone-8-plus-2017-10):
> The iPhone X actually features Apple's biggest phone display, measuring 5.8 inches on the diagonal, which is even bigger than the display on Apple's largest iPhone, the iPhone 8 Plus, which measures 5.5 inches.

Here's the issue. The iPhone X, like other small bezel phones, has an 18:9 aspect ratio. This means the screen is twice as tall as it is wide. This is the first change since the iPhone 6 introduced the 16:9 aspect ratio. iPhones before the 6 had a 3:2 aspect ratio.

If two screens have the same aspect ratio, then the diagonal length of the display is a perfectly reasonable metric to use for comparison. Of course, no one is actually interested in the diagonal length (it's the *area* of the screen that matters), but the geometry works out so that diagonal length is a perfectly fine proxy.

However, if two screens have different aspect ratios, then the diagonal length of the display is a misleading and uninformative metric. Here's an example, where I've drawn a square with diagonal length of 1 unit and a rectangle with diagonal length of 1.5 units. By diagonal length, the rectangle has a 50% larger screen. By screen area, the rectangle is 23% smaller than the square.

Taken to its limit, I can make a screen size of enormous diagonal length but minuscule screen area by continuing to elongate the rectangle and shrink its width.

Not all tech reviewers have overlooked this fact. Phone Arena [did the math](https://www.phonearena.com/news/Apple-iPhone-Xs-5.8-inch-screen-is-actually-smaller-than-the-5.5-inch-iPhone-8-Plus-display_id98116), and the screen area of the 5.8 inch iPhone X is 2.6% smaller than the 5.5 inch iPhone Plus.
