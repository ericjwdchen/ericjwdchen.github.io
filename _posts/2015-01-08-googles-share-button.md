title: Google's Share Button

Google's Material Design promises to not only to bring consistency across products, but also to bring consistency within Google’s design language itself.

While Google properties on the whole have made the Material Design transition, there is still one glaring omission.

## The Canonical Share Button

This is the Google's [sanctioned][sanctioned] share button.

And most Google properties use the right one.

## The Wrong Share Button

But some use this.
[Youtube app][Google trends][Youtube web interface]
Here it is in use in GMail.

And here it is in use in Inbox.

This button is almost worse than being obscure. It’s legitimately confusing because a reflected version of it “reply - insert the actual glyph if possible” glyph means reply.

Inexplicable. A bad icon badly points in the general direction of its functionality. A terrible icon boldly points in the wrong way. Let's make 2016 the year of the consistent share button.
