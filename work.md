A collection of projects I've worked on recently.

##The Lawrence (2014-2015)

This is a project that I worked on for my school newspaper. I built a brand-new WordPress theme to meet the specific demands of our newspaper.

My primary focus was responsive design. The previous theme was a fixed-width layout, but for my new theme, I built a flexible two-column layout that compresses to one-column on phones.

The other focus was on design more generally. I wanted the site to be easy to navigate. I ended up dividing the navigation to primary and secondary. The primary navigation is what you would expect to see flipping through a physical newspaper: News, Editorial, Sports, etc. I placed this navigation in bold directly under the logo.

I decided to place less-used navigation in a secondary group, primarily featuring links that are 'bonus' to the physical newspaper: About, Masthead, Contact, etc.

###Article Page

My goal for the article page was to put 100% of the focus on the article itself. Too often, sites have overbearing sidebars, distracting ads, or other visually distracting features on what is ostensibly a page to present text.

To achieve this goal, I used the size and color of the text to communicate importance and purpose. For example, the biggest thing you see on the page is the headline. This sounds simple enough, but there are sites where the headline is not clearly the focus of the page.

I chose to show which category the article was in with a smaller green text. And I have the byline and publishing date in small text right under the headline.

Put all together, I was able to communicate a consistent structure to the user without heavy use of icons and other more attention-demanding visual indicators. By keeping the level of noise low, I was able to let the signal—the article itself—come through.
