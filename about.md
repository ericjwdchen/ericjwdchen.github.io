## How the Sausage is Made

This site is built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), forked originally from [Poole](http://getpoole.com/), and generously hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The repository for the website is [here](https://github.com/ericjwdchen/ericjwdchen.github.io).

Math equations are created using [MathJax][mj]. Syntax highlighting is done using [highlight.js][h.js].

The [logo][l] is an homage to the brown [Zune 30][Zune 30], Microsoft's deeply flawed yet iconic iPod competitor and my favorite electronic device. Mine was white, but brown makes for a better logo.
