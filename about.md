Hey there! I'm Eric Chen.

I'm from Wisconsin, studied Operations Research and Financial Engineering at [Princeton][pu], and working in Chicago now. Take a look at the [bookshelf][bookshelf] to see what I've been reading recently.

## How It's Made

This site is built on [Jekyll][jekyll], originally forked from [Poole][poole], and hosted on [GitHub Pages][gp]. The Git repository for the website lives [here][repo]. I write all posts in [Visual Studio Code][vscode]. Math equations are formatted with [MathJax][mj].

The site's favicon is an homage to the brown [Zune 30][Zune 30], Microsoft's deeply flawed yet iconic iPod competitor and my favorite electronic device. Mine was white, but brown makes a better logo.
