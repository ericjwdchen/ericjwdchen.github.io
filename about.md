Hey there! I'm Eric Chen.

![Eric Chen headshot](/assets/2015/01/eric-chen.jpg){: .img-right .img-circular}

I'm from Wisconsin and am a senior at [Princeton University][pu]. In my past, I attended [The Lawrenceville School][ls]. I take interest in technology, finance, transportation, podcasts, and cooking. Take a look at the [bookshelf][bookshelf] to see what I've read recently.

You can find me on [Twitter][twitter], [LinkedIn][linkedin],[^1] and [Github][github]. If you like the site, check out the [Feeds][feeds] page to find ways to subscribe. My email is eric~at~ericjwdchen.org.

## How the Sausage is Made

This site is built on [Jekyll][jekyll], forked originally from [Poole][poole], and generously hosted on [GitHub Pages][gp]. All posts are composed in the [Atom][atom] text editor. The repository for the website is [here][repo].

Math equations are created using [MathJax][mj]. Syntax highlighting for code snippets is done with [highlight.js][h.js] using the Solarized Light theme.

The site favicon is an homage to the brown [Zune 30][Zune 30], Microsoft's deeply flawed yet iconic iPod competitor and my favorite electronic device. Mine was white, but brown makes for a better logo.
