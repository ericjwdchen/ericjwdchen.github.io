#How the Sausage is Made

This site is built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), originally forked from [Poole](http://getpoole.com/), and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The logo is an homage to the brown [Zune 30](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zune_30), the worst, best, and first portable device I could call my own[^2].

[^1]: Pro tip: avocados + anything savory. Here is a long addition to test out the capability to handle paragraphs.

[^2]: Mine was white, but brown was the more iconic.
