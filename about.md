Hey there! I'm Eric Chen.

![Eric Chen headshot](/assets/2015/01/eric-chen.jpg){: .img-right .img-circular}

I'm from Wisconsin and am a senior at [Princeton University][pu] studying Operations Research and Financial Engineering. Prior to Princeton, I attended [The Lawrenceville School][ls]. Currently, I take interest in technology, finance, transportation, history of religion, podcasts, and cooking. Take a look at the [bookshelf][bookshelf] to see what I've been reading recently.

You can find me on [Twitter][twitter], [LinkedIn][linkedin],[^1] and [Github][github]. If you like the site, check out the [Feeds][feeds] page to subscribe. My email is eric~at~this_domain.

## How the Sausage is Made

This site is built on [Jekyll][jekyll], originally forked from [Poole][poole], and generously hosted on [GitHub Pages][gp]. The Git repository for the website lives [here][repo].

All posts are composed in [Visual Studio Code][vscode], my text editor of choice.

Math equations are created using [MathJax][mj].

The site's favicon is an homage to the brown [Zune 30][Zune 30], Microsoft's deeply flawed yet iconic iPod competitor, and my favorite electronic device. Mine was white, but the brown makes for a unique logo.
