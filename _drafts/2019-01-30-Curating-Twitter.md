title: Curating Twitter
---

I like to keep a high signal-to-noise ratio in my Twitter feed. I follow < 50 people, and I strongly prefer people that tweet relatively infrequently (< 10 tweets per day) and that tweet very often tweet about things I find interesting.

However, there are many more people I would like to follow. Some of these people either tweet too frequently, or they inconsistently tweet things that I find interesting. Now that Twitter has an algorithmic timeline, I wish you could specify what types of content you like to see, similar how the Youtube recommended videos work. But, they don't. 

In the past, I've just visited these people's Twitter page directly every week or so and skimmed for their most interesting content. While this keeps them out of my daily Twitter feed, I still need to sift through many tweets to find the most interesting ones. I decided to write a small Python script to show me someone's best tweets from the past week. This way, I can see collated results for multiple users all at once and not have to sift through their posts.
